# GigConomy : Decentralized Freelancing Platform for Global Gig Economy 🤝

## Problem we are solving:

**“Trust”** is a key factor for successful transactions between parties. To ensure trust, we involve third party freelancing platforms or middlemen and pay hefty commissions which highly affect the overall profit margins of parties involved in a transaction.

**GigConomy** : Decentralized Freelancing Platform for Global Gig Economy 🤝 which helps individuals and businesses to grow globally and increase profit margins in four simple steps:

**1) List Products,Services or subscription packages.**

**2) Create Escrow agreements with personalize terms as per customers.**

**3) Send/Receive crypto payments in reliable and secure way without paying hefty commissions to third parties.**

**Challenges we have faced:** When we started building, we had so many ideas for features and functionalities to implement in GigConomy. We had too many ideas like we can build a freelancing platform, we can build a review system for businesses and so on. As a startup we knew that too many features or trying to cover too many use cases at once will confuse the users and implemented minimum possible features to solve one use case.
